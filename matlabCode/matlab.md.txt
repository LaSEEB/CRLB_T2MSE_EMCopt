This file helps testing matlab developed codes.

1 - Fast Spin Echo (FSE = MSE) optimization with CRLB
 
Folder: CRLB_optimization

    #1 - You need to add to the Matlab path the toolbox of Pulseq
    #2 - Edit path in 'FSE_optimization_TRvar.m' and run
    #3 - Outputs, the best model for a specific SNR and T2 value

2 - Test sequence with JEMRIS

Folder: JEMRIS_simulation

    #1 - You need to install JEMRIS (http://www.jemris.org/) to run
    #2 - Run 'runMSE_JEMRIS.m' - to generate image from JEMRIS software. The Image will mimic the design sequence from CRLB_optimization
    #3 - Run 'T2_MSE_JEMRIS_Test.m' to generate template mathching and prediction for T2 values of the simulated phantom.
